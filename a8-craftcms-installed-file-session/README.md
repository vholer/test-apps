## Installation

You can check out Happy Lager online from [demo.craftcms.com](https://demo.craftcms.com/).

If you want to install the site locally, follow these instructions:

1. Download/clone the repo on your computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/craftcms/demo.git happylager.test
   ```

2. Run `composer install` within the clone:

   ```bash
   cd happylager.test
   composer install
   ```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file at the root of the project to `.env`, and set its `DB_SERVER`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD`  variables to the correct values. (If you’re on a Mac, you may need to type <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> in Finder to show hidden files.)

4. Ensure that the following files and directories have permissions that will allow PHP to read and write to them:

   - `.env`
   - `composer.json`
   - `composer.lock`
   - `config/license.key`
   - `storage/*`
   - `vendor/*`
   - `web/cpresources/*`

5. Run this command in the CLI from your project's root to automatically generate a security key for the site: `php craft setup/security-key`

6. Create a new MySQL database called `happylager`, and import `happylager.sql` into it.

7. Create a new virtual host with the hostname `happylager.test` that points to the `happylager.test/web/` folder.

8. Edit your `hosts` file to resolve `happylager.test` to `127.0.0.1`, if necessary.

Now point your browser at `http://happylager.test`. You should see the Happy Lager homepage.
